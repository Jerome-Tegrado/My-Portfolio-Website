                            I created this showreel using Filmora, spending 1-2 hours on it. I admit that it wasn’t perfect, but I believe that with enough time, training, and preparation, I can produce better showreels. I gathered ideas from YouTube showreel references and started my own project using videos from Pexels. Thanks to Pexels for providing the videos. The ideas and content were entirely my own. I used the videos for inspiration and did not follow any tutorials; I started from scratch with video references and my own concepts. This is my first showreel, and with only 1-2 hours to prepare and develop my idea, it was also my first experience with creating showreels.
